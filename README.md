# USFSA Intercollegiate Figure Skating Results Processing

Hi there!

I created this repo purely for enjoyment; this mini project aims to bridge the gap between the release of individual results and team results at intercollegiate figure skating competitions. Traditionally, individual results are released live and team results are released sporadically throughout the competition. At some competitions, skaters and teams may need to wait until the competition has concluded for information on team standings.
