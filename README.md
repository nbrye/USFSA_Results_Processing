# USFSA Intercollegiate Figure Skating Results Processing

 A project designed to web-scrape intercollegiate figure skating results and calculate live team standings. Live calculation of team standings and point total projections allow teams to create better point earning strategies and attempt to qualify for nationals (in which the top four teams in each conference qualify). More about collegiate figure skating and how conferences/competitions work can be found at the following pages:

 This script is currently being used as a notebook, the most recent version being `'/notebooks/USFSA_Results_Processing_V5.ipynb'`. In order to run the notebook and calculate results, specify the competition of interest after `main_url =` and run all cells in the notebook.
