# USFSA Intercollegiate Figure Skating Results Processing

Hi there!

This is something I wrote purely for enjoyment; it's purpose is to aid intercollegiate figure skating teams in knowing where they stand throughout each qualifying competition. Traditionally the live team results at each competition fall behind the live individual results, and this aims to bridge that gap.
